1,haider.jafri,haider.jafri,Hi,109
1,william98,william98,guys can you enabled,108
1,william98,william98,hi,107
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,or you will do it on your own,106
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Should I set it to run every 5 minute,105
1,william98,william98,okay do that,104
1,william98,william98,ohh i see,103
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,"is there any option to set it to run every 5 minute, other wise the cron processes will be pilling up.",102
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,and have just killed the artisan processes which were stuck since 12th August 2017,101
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Seems like it is also helping quite effectively in increasing the server load,100
1,william98,william98,i am currently running something on the server,99
1,william98,william98,yes,98
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,<@william98> Seems you have set the artisian cron to run every minute,97
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,"Ok I would like you to do not make any change now, we are monitoring some other parameters",96
1,william98,william98,except we simulate the traffic,95
1,william98,william98,we cannot test,94
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,But we suggest our customers to first test any sort of change on the staging before pushing on the live one,93
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Sure <@william98> We will help you out,92
1,william98,william98,if issues arises and i cannot work help me change it to database,91
1,william98,william98,i would change to redis,90
1,william98,william98,i need you to promise me something,89
1,william98,william98,okay,88
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,"This is what I am saying, with Redis we hope that the issue won't occur but still requires bit of testing. Without any such environment, I can not concrete my words. Let see",87
1,william98,william98,before doing that,86
1,william98,william98,i want to know,85
1,william98,william98,not yet,84
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Have you set the redis as the session handler?,83
1,william98,william98,with redis?,82
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,"It depends <@william98> As per current setup, the query should not take much time but issue occurs because of the excessive number of queries.",81
1,william98,william98,?,80
1,william98,william98,does it eat cpu resources,79
1,william98,william98,can redis crash,78
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,you may use the following command to monitor the redis  redis-cli monitor,77
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Ok then try Redis for the sessions,76
1,william98,william98,no prefix,75
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Sure,74
1,william98,william98,let me google,73
1,william98,william98,laravel does that,72
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Is there any special string or prefix for the sessions?,71
1,william98,william98,right?,70
1,william98,william98,so would redis be a good solution,69
1,william98,william98,and we cannot tell which session belongs to an admin,68
1,william98,william98,and they were complaining so much,67
1,william98,william98,"the problem with that is, it disconnects the admin users",66
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,without imposing load on the server,65
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,"Well setting up as Files will not slow down, because we have applied the cron job which  will be deleting the old sessions",64
1,william98,william98,interesting,63
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,<@cloudways.ahmed> uploaded a file: <https://cw-premium.slack.com/files/cloudways.ahmed/F6PAPHVD1/2017-08-16_20h19_29.png|2017-08-16_20h19_29.png>,62
1,william98,william98,i dont want to use files,61
1,william98,william98,if we change it to redis would it be preferred,60
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Let me show the screenshot,59
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Yes,58
1,william98,william98,?,57
1,william98,william98,that is what is eating resources right,56
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,Execut updating delete from `sessions` where `last_activity` <= ?,55
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,the following query is running multiple time which I believe is killing the orphaned sessions,54
1,william98,william98,files was slowing down the server,53
1,william98,william98,i have,52
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,instead of FILES,51
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,<@william98> Seems like you have set the database as the session storage,50
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,ok please hold. Let me check,49
1,william98,william98,and also what currently is eating cpu resources,48
1,william98,william98,people what is the load average,47
1,william98,william98,great,46
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,"Sure, we are here to serve you in any way we can. Do not need to worry about any thing",45

1,william98,william98,i have created the file,42
1,william98,william98,ohh okay,41
1,cloudways.ahmed,cloudways.ahmed,And I believe it's not a correct one,40
